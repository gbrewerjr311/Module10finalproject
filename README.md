## Technical Documentation

### Where the Code is Hosted
The codes is hosted on GitHub via this link: gbrewerjr311/Module10finalproject

### How to run/build/deploy the program
To run you must download all files and run with the Python IDLE, or Pycharm, or Visual Studio Code.
And to run and deploy should "run" in file "Main.py"
### Languages and Technologies
The code provided is written in Python. Python is a popular programming language known for simplicity and readability. This code does not use any specific framework or library, as it consists of standalone functions and procedural code.

### System Requirements and Supported Applications
System requirements: Windows and MacOS, can run on any specs regarding your ram, graphics card, and CPU.
### Coding/Naming Conventions
The code follows the Python coding conventions for function and variable names, which are generally written in lowercase with underscores separating words (snake_case). Here are some of the conventions used in the code:
1. Function Names: The function names are descriptive and follow the convention of using lowercase letters with underscores. For example, `visit_crime_scene()`, `interview_witnesses()`, `check_victim_home()`, etc.

2. Commenting: The comments are written using the `#` symbol at the beginning of the line, providing brief explanations of the code's purpose or indicating the code to be implemented.
3. Function Structure: Each function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses for any possible parameters. The code within each function is indented with four spaces to define the function scope.
4. Print Statements: The print statements provide informative messages and are enclosed in parentheses. For example, `print("You arrive at the crime scene.")`, `print("You gather evidence such as fingerprints, blood samples, etc.")`, etc.
5. Variable Names: The variables used in the code are simple and self-explanatory, such as `choice` in the `deal_with_killer()` function.
6. String Formatting: The code uses simple string formatting techniques, such as using the `print()` function with parentheses and passing strings as arguments.
Overall, the code follows standard Python conventions, which enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Overview of the Architecture
Overall, the game offers a structured and linear experience where the player assumes the role of a detective, investigates a series of murders, gathers evidence, interviews witnesses and suspects, follows leads, and ultimately confronts the killer. The player's choices during the game, such as the way they deal with the killer, can influence the outcome of the story.

### How to Start the Program (Start the Game)
To start the game, you can simply run the script by executing it with a Python interpreter. Here's how you can start the game:
1. Save the code in a Python file with a `.py` extension, for example, `crime_game.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file using the `cd` command.
4. Run the script by typing `python crime_game.py` and press Enter.
Once you execute the script, it will start the game by printing the introductory messages for each chapter and simulating the gameplay by calling the respective functions. You'll see the progress of the game and interact with the prompts displayed on the screen.
Please note that you need to have Python installed on your computer to run the script. If Python is properly installed and configured, the game should start and display the desired output.
